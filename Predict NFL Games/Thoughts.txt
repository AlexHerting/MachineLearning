What data do I need to be looking at? We should look at 1 team and try and predict the outcome of their next game. We will have these stats for both teams.
date, time of day, day of the week, offensive rating, defensive rating, redzone effectiveness, avg ppg, avg points against per game, number of injuries, is starting qb injured, # of injuries, wins this season, losses this season, divisional game, location, historical win % against this team, last meeting result against opponent, past 5 games win %, pass yds/game, rushing yds/game, rushing yds against/game, passing yards against/game, turnovers/game, average time of possession, penalties per game, sacks per game, ints per game, fumbles recovered per game.

Stats I have so far from 1970-2023 chicago bears:
result, location, opponent

How I plan on setting up my data, create the same thing for all 32 teams as I did with the bears. Then get the stats of each team from each year 1970-2023 in a different csv file. I then will compare the year and the name of the team to append the data to new columns which will in result create complete data for all 32 teams. I will then combine all 32 of those teams data into 1 large csv file to train the model on. I will remove the date from the file and have the index just be a basic indexing index (1,2,3...).
